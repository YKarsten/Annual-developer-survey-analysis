# Annual-developer-survey-analysis

## Data analysis

The present data analysis project builds upon the 2023 survey and explores some of its features with emphasis on the data and business analysis field of industry.  
The survey data has already been cleaned by the stack overflow team and is ready to be used for anaylsis. As the survey result csv file is too large for githubs default upload I'll reference it here instead.  
It is part of my portfolio in data analysis. You can find the file at [insights.stackoverflow.com/survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).
